You need the 1.x version of the Perl driver. Earlier versions won't work.

If your system does not come with it, you can grab it (or the
components mongoe uses) here:

https://github.com/mongodb/mongo-perl-driver/tree/master/lib/MongoDB

The lazyscrape.pl utility will attempt to do this for you, but it's fragile
and may easily break due to changes upstream. Eventually a more robust way
to manage these dependencies will be added (or the dependencies will be
changed)
