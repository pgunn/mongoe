mongoe - An endpoint service

Purpose:
You have many mongo databases, you have lots of code that needs to talk to
those databases, but you don't want the code to need to know where those
databases are. Rather than updating all the code when an endpoint changes,
make a bunch of "mongoe" systems that act as endpoints, and point your
code at those; they will send your data to the correct mongod
transparently. If you move your data, just reconfigure your mongo endpoints.

Status:
This is a proof-of-concept. It doesn't do adequate error checking, and
it doesn't handle version differences between servers intelligently or
prevent you from doing operations that are by-protocol designed to be
specific to whom you're talking to. Future versions may be less dumb,
but if you really want this kind of functionality, learn from this code
and do it better.

Right now this doesn't do at all the right thing with repsets; it acts as
if standalone mongod processes are all that exist. It eventually should be
aware of primaries/secondaries, and possibly other kinds of grouping of
mongo systems that are still being used.
