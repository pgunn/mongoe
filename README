mongoe - An endpoint service

Purpose:
You have many mongo databases, you have lots of code that needs to
talk to those databases, but you don't want the code to need to know
where those databases are. Rather than updating all the code when an
endpoint changes, make a bunch of "mongoe" systems that act as
endpoints, and point your code at those; they will send your data to
the correct mongod transparently. If you move your data, just
reconfigure your mongo endpoints.

Language Status:
This is a multi-language project.
*Perl - Will always be the primary language
*Python - Mostly stubs, does not yet function
*C - Not yet started
*(other languages) - Not yet started

As the code matures and the right abstractions become apparent, I
will split libraries out of the codebase suitable for other projects,
also in every language the program is ported to.

Code status:
Fairly immature - do not use in production, has severe bugs and limitations.
Doesn't do adequate error checking, doesn't understand different versions
of the wire protocol. Assumes its endpoints are standalone mongod processes.
If you find problems, please report them as Github issues (be specific).
