mongoe - An endpoint service

Purpose:
You have many mongo databases, you have lots of code that needs to talk to those databases,
but you don't want the code to need to know where those databases are. Rather than updating
all the code when an endpoint changes, make a bunch of "mongoe" systems that act as endpoints,
and point your code at those; they will send your data to the correct mongod transparently.
If you move your data, just reconfigure your mongo endpoints.

Status:
This is largely a proof-of-concept. It doesn't do adequate error checking, and it doesn't
handle version differences between servers intelligently or prevent you from doing operations
that are by-protocol designed to be specific to whom you're talking to. Future versions may be
less dumb, but if you really want this kind of functionality, learn how I did this and do it better.
